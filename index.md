# BYOA - Real-Time Database

In this project, you will use your knowledge of Swift, Networking, and Firebaseâ€™s Real-Time Database to build an app of your choosing! Building apps on your own will not only strengthen your skills but also allow you better learn your strengths.

Students who complete this project independently or as a pairing will showcase their understanding of the following principles:

* Basic Storyboard constraints
* Constants, Variables, and Basic Data Types
* Collections
* Functions
* Control Flow
* IBActions && IBOutlets
* Firebase Real-Time Database

---

## Requirements:
Your completed app must:

* Create data within the app and sync to Firebase RTDB
* Fetch data from Firebase RTDB
* Your `model` should contain at least `three` separate data types.
  * String
  * Date
  * Int
* The app should be built with `MVVM` architecture
* Two views
  * Can be a single view if the design is `amazing`  


You got this!

## Design

The design of your app is entirely up to you! Do want to have a list view that displays the data? Maybe you want the user to have the option to navigate to a detail screen to see additional information? It's all up to you!

Feel free to reference any past project for inspiration and syntax support.
